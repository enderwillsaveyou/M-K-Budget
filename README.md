# M-K-Budget

A simple budget application framework for tracking a family's income and expenses. The UI is built with Python's `tkinter` library and provides fields for entering monthly income along with house, car, and other bills. It then calculates the remaining balance for the month.

## Requirements

- Python 3 with the `tkinter` module available (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Usage

Run the application with:

```bash
python budget_app.py
```

Enter the income and expense amounts and click **Calculate** to see the monthly balance.
